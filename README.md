# delay
A module to calculate smarter delays. 
- This can be used for alerts and alarms to avoid alarm fatigue. 
- This can be used to calculate subsequent wait times before re-trying a function that might take an unknown amount of time to complete.

** The module uses the fibonacci sequence to determine the delay increase. A delay factor can also be used to increase the delay by a multiple, at creation time.
